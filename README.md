# **Implementing a Multi-Environment Application Deployment with Kustomize**

## Project Overview

This project focuses on deploying a web application across multiple environments—development, staging, and production—using Kustomize. The project emphasizes efficient configuration management, environment-specific customization, and integration with a CI/CD pipeline, demonstrating practical skills in Kubernetes deployment practices.

## Why This Project Is Relevant

Managing Kubernetes configurations across multiple environments can quickly become complex and error-prone. This project teaches how to leverage Kustomize to maintain clear, reusable, and environment-specific configurations while ensuring smooth deployment through automated CI/CD pipelines.

## Project Goals and Objectives

* Learn how to structure and manage Kubernetes resources using Kustomize.
* Implement environment-specific overlays for development, staging, and production.
* Integrate Kustomize into a CI/CD workflow to automate deployments.
* Handle sensitive data securely using ConfigMaps and Secrets.
* Demonstrate advanced Kustomize features like transformers and generators.

## Prerequisites

* Basic knowledge of Kubernetes concepts (Deployments, Services, ConfigMaps, Secrets).
* Familiarity with Git version control.
* Understanding of CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions, Jenkins, or similar).
* Basic command-line and YAML configuration skills.

## Project Deliverables

* A structured Kustomize project repository with base and overlay configurations.
* A CI/CD pipeline integrated with Kustomize deployments.
* Properly documented `README.md` explaining project setup and deployment steps.
* Use of ConfigMaps and Secrets for secure configuration management.

## Tools & Technologies Used

* Kubernetes
* Kustomize
* Git
* CI/CD platform (GitHub Actions or Jenkins)
* YAML configuration files

## Project Components

* **Base Directory:** Contains the core Kubernetes resources for the web application.
* **Overlays Directory:** Contains environment-specific configurations (`dev`, `staging`, `prod`).
* **CI/CD Pipeline:** Automates deployment of the application when changes occur.
* **Secrets & ConfigMaps:** Manages sensitive and environment-specific configuration data.
* **Documentation:** Clear instructions and explanations in `README.md`.

Perfect! We can update **Task 1** to include the `patch.yaml` files in each overlay environment. Here’s the revised version:

### **Task 1: Set Up Your Project Directory and Structure (Complete)**

**Objective:** Create the foundational project structure with all necessary directories and starter files for a Kustomize-based multi-environment deployment project, including overlay patches.

**Steps:**

1. Create the main project directory:

```bash
mkdir kustomize-capstone
cd kustomize-capstone
```

2. Create core subdirectories for Kustomize:

```bash
mkdir -p base
mkdir -p overlays/dev
mkdir -p overlays/staging
mkdir -p overlays/prod
```

3. Create supporting directories and files:

```bash
mkdir images             # For storing screenshots or diagrams for README
touch README.md           # Project documentation
touch .gitignore          # To exclude unnecessary files (e.g., .DS_Store, node_modules)
```

4. Create starter files inside `base/` (can be empty initially):

```bash
touch base/deployment.yaml
touch base/service.yaml
touch base/kustomization.yaml
```

5. Create starter files for overlays, including patch files:

```bash
touch overlays/dev/kustomization.yaml
touch overlays/dev/patch.yaml
touch overlays/staging/kustomization.yaml
touch overlays/staging/patch.yaml
touch overlays/prod/kustomization.yaml
touch overlays/prod/patch.yaml
```

### **Project Directory Structure After Task 1**

```
kustomize-capstone/
├── base/
│   ├── deployment.yaml
│   ├── service.yaml
│   └── kustomization.yaml
├── overlays/
│   ├── dev/
│   │   ├── kustomization.yaml
│   │   └── patch.yaml
│   ├── staging/
│   │   ├── kustomization.yaml
│   │   └── patch.yaml
│   └── prod/
│       ├── kustomization.yaml
│       └── patch.yaml
├── images/
├── README.md
└── .gitignore
```

**Outcome:**

* Project directory fully structured for Kustomize deployment across `dev`, `staging`, and `prod` environments.
* Overlay directories now include both `kustomization.yaml` and `patch.yaml` for environment-specific customizations.
* Supporting files for documentation and visuals are ready.

## **Task 2: Initialize Git Repository**

**Objective:** Set up version control for your project to track changes, maintain history, and prepare for future integration with a remote repository and CI/CD pipelines.

### **Steps:**

1. **Initialize Git in your project directory**
   Navigate to your project root and initialize Git:

```bash
cd kustomize-capstone
git init
```

This creates a new local Git repository.

2. **Update `.gitignore`**
   Add files and directories that should be ignored by Git. This helps prevent committing unnecessary or sensitive files. Sample `.gitignore` for this project:

```gitignore
# OS files
.DS_Store
Thumbs.db

# Kustomize build artifacts
*.yaml.bak
*.tmp

# Kubernetes temporary files
*.kube*

# IDE and editor folders
.vscode/
.idea/

# Node dependencies (if any)
node_modules/
```

3. **Stage all files for initial commit**

```bash
git add .
```

4. **Commit the project structure**

```bash
git commit -m "Initialize Git repository and add project structure"
```

This records your current project state in Git locally.

5. **Optional: Connect to a remote repository (GitHub, GitLab, etc.)**
   Since your project is fresh, you can skip this for now. When ready, add the remote and push:

```bash
git remote add origin <your-repo-url>
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

Replace `<your-repo-url>` with the URL of your Git repository.

### **Outcome:**

* Git is initialized and tracking all project files locally.
* `.gitignore` ensures unnecessary or temporary files are not committed.
* Initial commit preserves the project structure and starter files.
* The project is ready for future changes, CI/CD integration, and eventual push to a remote repository.
